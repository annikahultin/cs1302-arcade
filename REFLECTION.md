1. **DONE:** Downloaded the starter code and decided which game to implement. Idea is to create
    a version of Reversi by using a tilepane to hold image views that will represent each square
    of the board. Update the images based on the user's move.

2. **TODO:** Begin setting up the scene that I will use to represent the game and play around with
    the shapes and keyboard features in Java.

3. **BRANCHING:** Will create branches for each new addition I make for the game. For example, I will
    create a branch while creating the layout of the scene. I will also create a new branch while creating
    the score feature, or keyboard commands for the users to make moves.
