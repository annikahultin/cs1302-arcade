1. **DONE:** Downloaded the starter code and decided which game to implement. Idea is to create
    a version of Reversi by using a tilepane to hold image views that will represent each square
    of the board. Update the images based on the user's move.

2. **TODO:** Begin setting up the scene that I will use to represent the game and play around with
    the shapes and keyboard features in Java.

3. **BRANCHING:** Will create branches for each new addition I make for the game. For example, I will
    create a branch while creating the layout of the scene. I will also create a new branch while creating
    the score feature, or keyboard commands for the users to make moves.

1. **DONE:** Created basic outline of the gameboard. Designed my images for the game pieces and retrieved
    the url for the image after posting them on facebook. The title scene is complete, however I will
    likely make more modifications to it to make it look cleaner.

2. **TODO:** Begin working on the mouse events and create the actual game loop. Need to figure out how I want
    to implement the mouse events. I do not think I will use keyboard events to implement this game.

3. **BRANCHING:** Created the braches titlewindow and gamewindow that I used when I was designing the title
    and game windows. I merged titlewindow back to master after I was finished with the basic desgin for
    the title window of the game. Merged gamewindow back to the master branch when I completed the design for
    the game window.
